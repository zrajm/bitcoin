      <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency. In order to make it secure, the
        underlying architecture is quite complex. I’ll here try to cover what
        you need to know to use Bitcoin, rather than try to explain it all.
        (There are plenty of <a href="#references">other resources</a>, if you
        want to know more about the nitty gritty.)

      <p>The symbols <b>Ƀ</b> and <b>฿</b> are used, as well as the symbol to
        the right. Bitcoin also have its own currency
        abbreviation: <i><abbr>BTC</abbr>.</i> In practice
        however, <a href="http://preev.com/btc/usd">a single Bitcoin is so
        expensive</a> that the term
        milli-Bitcoin <nobr>(or <i>m<abbr>BTC</abbr></i>)</nobr> is frequently
        used. (Though an everyday name for them has yet to be established –
        <i><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MilliBit">Millibits?
        Millies?</a> <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198316.msg2064590#msg2064590">Bitties?</a> <a href="http://konradsgraf.com/blog1/2013/6/3/the-ms-and-bs-of-millibitcoin-redenomination.html">Embies?</a></i>
        or just <i><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8282.msg133269#msg133269">Bits</a>,</i> maybe?)

      <section>
        <h2>What Are Bitcoins Like?</h2>

        <p><b>Bitcoin is more similar cash</b> (i.e. bills and coins) than any
          other electronic money system. You can transfer Bitcoin to (and
          receive Bitcoin from) anyone you want, no one can stop you, and you
          can transfer money anonymously. Once you’ve transferred an amount to
          someone else – it’s gone. (You can ask the recipient to transfer the
          money back to you, but it is not possible to stop the transaction.)
          There are also <em>no limits</em> on how little, or how much, you’re
          allowed to transfer.

        <p>Your Bitcoins are stored in a <i>wallet</i> (on your computer, or on
          one of the <i>eWallet</i> providers). Anyone who can read your
          wallet, can also access your money. (Yes, your wallet can be stolen –
          but you can also encrypt your wallet so that the thief is unable to
          access its content.) If you lose your wallet, you lose your money
          (just like with the wallet in your pocket). But you can make any
          number of backups of your wallet.

        <p><b>Bitcoin is <i>unlike</i> cash</b> in that it can be sent over the
          Internet. <!-- FIXME: transfer costs? -->
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2>

        <p>Some people would try to convince you that Bitcoin is good for
          various ideologial reasons (e.g. because it's free, anonymous or
          non-centralized), and while some of us humans still have ideologies
          that we hold dear, people tend to adopt technologies that makes life
          easier rather than more just.

        <p>So how do you benefit from using Bitcoin?

        <p><b>It's cheap.</b> Each transaction costs a little something, but
          the charge I really small (compared to what the banks charge for
          transfers using their credit or debit cards). <!-- FIXME: How expensive?
          Flat rate or percentage? -->

        <p>Also the money you pay go to the people maintaining the Bitcoin
          computer network (and if you want to join them you can set up your
          own server and receive money for handling other people's
          transactions).

        <p><b><i>Anyone</i> can send and receive Bitcoin.</b> – Sure, you can
          pay for your coffee, buy a new bed, or pay your rent with Bitcoin
          (assuming your local coffeeshop, furniture store and housing company
          take the currency) but <nobr>– unlike</nobr> with Visa
          or <nobr>MasterCard –</nobr> you’re not limited to transferring money
          to companies, shops and businesses. You can just as easily transfer
          Bitcoin to a friend to pay what you owe her for the beer last night,
          you can buy a secondhand bookshelf at a garage sale or pay the
          neighbours kid's when they cut that lawn for you. And when some
          random stranger offers you serious money for that *ridiculous* straw
          hat that you found in your grandmother's attic; all you need to do is
          whisk out your smartphones, have the stranger scan your Bitcoin
          address off your screen and transfer the amount to you, when you see
          the money appear in your account you can walk off secure in you
          knowledge that no one can ever step in and reverse that payment.

        <p><b>You can send money <i>anywhere.</i></b> Transferring money to the
          other side of the world is no harder then sending it to someone you
          meet face to face. In fact, the procedure (and the transaction
          charge) is exactly the same. If normal money transfers are cheap by
          Visa/MasterCard standards, international money transfers as
          fantastically cheap compared to the usual fees. In fact, if you often
          transfer money abroad you might find Bitcoin worth looking into *only
          because of this.*

        <p>Instead of scanning a barcode off a screen (as you'd do when paying
          someone just in front of you) you'll probably send the Bitcoin
          address by email.


        <!-- p><b>No complications.</b> -->



      

      <section>
        <h2><em>Where</em> Are My Bitcoins?</h2>

        <p>Picture it like this: There exist a special kind of transparent
          magic piggy bank – it is special kind of piggy bank because it is
          unbreakable, unpickable, and it also magically appears whenever
          anyone calls out its name. There is no way to take money out of it
          unless you have the key, but anyone can call for it, see what’s
          inside, and put more money into it.

        <figure class=right>
          <img src="piggy_bank.png" height=267 width=360>
          <figcaption>Special magic piggy bank.</figcaption>
        </figure>

    <p>And – as if that was not enough – there are <em>millions upon
      millions</em> of these magic piggy banks, and <em>anyone</em> can create
      new ones. In the piggy-creation-process a key to the piggy is created as
      well (the creator always gets a key). But after that, the key can be
      copied, given away, or even stolen, lost or destroyed.

    <p>Each piggie bank is a Bitcoin address, and in your wallet you have the
      keys which open your piggies – if you lose or delete your wallet then the
      money’s still out there, but no one (including yourself) can use them any
      more. If someone manages to steal your wallet, then they can also take
      your money. If you make many copies of your wallet, you don’t get more
      money, but you lessen the risk of you accidentally losing all your
      wallets.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have an eWallet provider you’re then
      entrusting them with your keys. If the provider get hacked, someone may
      grab your keys, then your money. (This has happened in the past, google
      “mybitcoin.com” for a horrific example.)
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Makes It Different From a Bank?</h2>

    <p>With Bitcoin there is no one central bank, instead there is a huge
      network of computers working together. People who participate in this
      network are rewarded (in Bitcoin, of course) and anyone can join (and
      leave) at any time without disrupting the network. There is no one
      central authority that takes care of all the Bitcoins, instead, when you
      do a transaction, you help doing a little bit of the work.

    <p>And then there is Bitcoin <i>mining,</i> but it’s a whole other thing
      that we won’t go into here (it’s not relevant for just sending and
      receiving Bitcoin).
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>I Hear It’s Anonymous, Is That True?</h2>

    <p>Sorta. All transactions to and from <i>an address</i> are fully
      traceable, back until the beginning of time (this in needed for the
      system to stay secure). However the system does not store any personal
      information about the owners of the addresses, and anyone can have an
      unlimited number of addresses making it impossible to trace
      transactions.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Bear that in mind if you <i>publish</i> an
      address (e.g. on the Internet) together with your name or other personal
      details then the fact that you own that address will be out, and anyone
      can see how much money you have there (though they will still not know if
      you have money in other addresses). The way the system is buildt, anyone
      can look up the current (and any past) balance of <em>any</em> account.

      <p>It’s very easy to create new addresses, and people often do that to
      increase anonymity, or just to easier spot where the money come from. If
      I, for example, rent out stuff I could give each customer their own
      payment address, so I can easily keep track of who paid what. Or I can
      have one address for donations to my web page, and one for my ice cream
      business. (All Bitcoin wallet programs allow you to attach a note to
      every address so you don’t have remember everything in your head.)
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id=software>Choosing Software</h2>

    <p><i>Speed</i> is the thing that differ most between different Bitcoin
      programs. Since your money exists only as a paper trail on the Bitcoin
      network’s servers, that paper trail will have to be downloaded before you
      can do any transactions. In some programs this is <i>horribly,
      horribly</i> slow (taking days, and downloading tens of gigabytes of
      data). <nobr>– If</nobr> you find your program to be this slow, you’ve
      chosen the wrong one, try installing something different.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id=terms>Some Terms Used</h2>

    <p><b>Address</b> or <i>account</i> (above also described as <i>“special
      magic piggy bank”</i>) Your “account number” (34 character long mixture
      of letters and digits), you need someone’s address in order to send them
      money. Any person can have an unlimited number of accounts.

    <p><b>Wallet</b> – A file containing <i>private keys,</i> one for each
      Bitcoin address. Contrary to its name, a Bitcoin wallet does not contain
      any actual <i>money</i> (all money is publicly stored in the Bitcoin
      server network), instead a wallet only contains a list of private keys,
      each allowing you to move Bitcoin from from one associated address
      (whomever have a private key for an address can spend the money there).

    <p>Make many copies of your wallet (if you lose them all, you lose the
      ability to spend those Bitcoin) <nobr>– but</nobr> make sure <i>all</i>
      your copies are secure (anyone who gain access to your private keys, can
      spend your money). All Bitcoin programs allow you to encrypt your wallet
      with a password.

    <p>The wallet does not explicitly contain Bitcoin addresses, as these are
      automatically calculated from the private key.

      <dd>A good multi-platform Bitcoin client. Even though it is written in

    <h2 id=about>About This Text</h2>

    <p>This was written after a couple of days reading up on, and playing with,
      Bitcoin. Even after intense googling I could not find any text that
      described Bitcoin in simple terms, from a user’s perspective, without
      going into loads of technical details about the underlying
      cryptography. <nobr>– I</nobr> basically wanted something that my mother
      would be able to read and understand without too much effort.

    <p>If you have ideas about what could be explained better (e.g. worded in
      an even simpler way) or if you want to point out something crucial that
      I’ve missed, please do so by sending an email to me
      at <a href="mailto:zrajm@zrajm.org">zrajm@zrajm.org</a>.

    <p>If you liked this page,
